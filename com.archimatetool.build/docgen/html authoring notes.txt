HTML source notes
-----------------
* Screenshots are based on the Archi application sized to 1011x763 pixels
* Ensure images in the HTML docs are no wider than 700 pixels
* If an image is sized differently to its original size then set both the height and width attributes of <img> in order to be sized properly in Word
  otherwise if an image is a 1:1 size you can omit both the width and height attributes
* Have one only <p>&nbsp;</p> at the end of each HTML file

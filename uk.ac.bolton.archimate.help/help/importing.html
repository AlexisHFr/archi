<h1>Importing Models from other Formats</h1>
<p>It is possible to import different formats into Archi. This is available from the main &quot;File-&gt;Import&quot; menu.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Import BiZZdesign Architect Model</h2>
<p>To import a <a href="http://www.bizzdesign.com/index.php/tools/architect">BiZZdesign Architect</a> Model select the menu item &quot;File-&gt;Import-&gt;BiZZdesign Architect Model...&quot; and choose an &quot;*.XMA&quot; file from the file selection dialog. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the &quot;*.XMA&quot; file from the desktop onto a blank area of the Model Tree.</p>
<p>Note that some features of BiZZdesign Architect are not supported in Archi and do not get imported. These include Profiles and some elements such as Goal, Principle and Guideline. Once these concepts are supported in Archi they will import correctly. Connection bend-points are not imported and recursive relationships are  not supported.</p>
<p>Note - this version of Archi only supports importing of BiZZdesign Architect version 2 models.</p>

<h2>Adding Elements and Relations from the Model Tree to a View</h2>
<p>Existing elements and relationships can be added to a View  by dragging and dropping them from the Model Tree to a View. Dragging and  dropping a relationship into a View also adds its source and target elements to  the View if they are not already present on the View. Any existing elements on  the View automatically have all their connections to the dropped element(s)  added as well.</p>
<p>Working this way means that you can regard the Model Tree as a repository of elements and relations for the model that can be added to any View within the same model.</p>
<p class="boxout"><img src="img/tip.png" width="13" height="18"> Note - while a  given model element or relationship can appear in more than one View, a given  element or relationship in the Model can only appear <em>once</em> in a given View.</p>

<h2>The Palette</h2>
<p>The palette contains the drawing tools, and elements and  relationships that can be added to a View.</p>

The Palette</p>
<p>To create new elements and relationships in a View select  the required element tool on the palette and either click or drag it onto the canvas  area. Once the figure has been added to the canvas you can resize and  re-position it by the usual drag actions.</p>
<p>Palette &quot;drawers&quot; may be opened and closed by clicking on  them, or they may be &quot;pinned&quot; open. You can also configure how the Palette displays items by right-clicking on the Palette and choosing how to display them:</p>

Palette Settings</p>
<p>If  you cannot see the palette in a View it may be closed. If this is the case, open  it by clicking the &quot;Show Palette&quot; triangle button at the top-right of the View  window. </p>
<p class="boxout"><strong><img src="img/tip.png" width="13" height="18"> Tip: Press the shift key when selecting a palette tool to keep it selected</strong><br>
  <br>
  By  default, once an element or connection has been drawn on the canvas the default  selection tool (arrow) is re-selected on the palette. If you wish to keep the  current palette tool selected hold the &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; key down when you select it.

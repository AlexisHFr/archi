<h2>Palette Creation Tools</h2>
<p>Apart from the <a href="view_palette_tools.html">Selection Tools</a> there are other tools available on the Palette used to create new ArchiMate elements, Notes, Groups and Relations between elements (connections). To add a new element or to the canvas select one and drag it onto or click onto the canvas.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>There are ten types of ArchiMate relation and three types of junction elements (the latter are not strictly connections but they are grouped with the relations on the Palette).</p>

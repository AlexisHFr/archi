    <h2>Jasper Reports</h2>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/jasperreports" target="_blank">Jasper Reports</a> is the world's most popular Java reporting engine. Combine data sources and produce pixel-perfect documents that can be viewed, printed, or exported into a variety of document formats with this powerful reporting   tool. Archi can export models in various formats using Jasper Reports Templates.</p>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Report-&gt;Jasper..." menu item from the main "File" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Provide the details in the following wizard:</p>

    <h2>HTML Reports</h2>
    
    <p>Archi supports a basic reporting functionality by means of generating a single HTML page containing summary tables of the model elements and the Views in a model.</p>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Report-&gt;HTML..." menu item from the main "File" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Select a folder to export the model and its Views.</p>
    
    <p>A single HTML page, "report.html" is generated in the chosen output folder together with image files for the Views in the model.</p>

<h1>Reporting</h1>
<p>Archi supports basic reporting functionality by means of generating  a single HTML page containing summary tables of the model elements and the  Views in a model.</p>
<p>This option is available from the &quot;Report-&gt;HTML...&quot; menu  item from the main &quot;File&quot; menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or  in a View this menu item is enabled. Select a folder to export the model and  its Views.</p>
<p>A  single HTML page, &quot;report.html&quot; is generated in the chosen output folder  together with image files for the Views in the model.</p>
